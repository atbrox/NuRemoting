Sample application displaying how you can embed a NuRemote into your iOS application.

What I've done to the project
-----------------------------
* Link to CFNetwork
* Pulled in all the files in "NuRemote"
* Pulled in all the files in Examples/Support to get the Nu
  language
* Created and ran an SPNuRemote instance at application startup.

Sample scripts
--------------

<pre><code>
(set del ((UIApplication sharedApplication) delegate))
(set nav (del navigationController))
(set root ((nav viewControllers) objectAtIndex:0))

(root insertNewObject)
</code></pre>
