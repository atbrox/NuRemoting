Sample application displaying how you can embed a NuRemote into your Mac application.

What I've done to the project
-----------------------------
* Link to readline, libffi and SystemConfiguration
* Pulled in all the files in "NuRemote"
* Pulled in all the files in Examples/Support to get the Nu
  language (except the ffi implementation, which is for iOS)
* Created and ran an SPNuRemote instance at application startup.

Sample scripts
--------------

<pre><code>
(set del ((NSApplication sharedApplication) delegate))
(set wi (del window))

(wi setFrame:'(100 300 200 100) display:1 animate:1)
</code></pre>
